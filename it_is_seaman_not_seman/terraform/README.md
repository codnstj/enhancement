## 🌊 Welcome! 🌊

This directory is where I manage my personal AWS infrastructure using **Terraform Cloud**. Everything here is configured and automated for efficiency, because who has time for manual setups? 🤷‍♂️

### 📜 What's Inside? 
Expect to find the following in this ever-expanding digital ocean:  
- 🚢 **Kubernetes (EKS)** – Because managing containers manually is so last decade.  
- 🌍 **Terraform** – The backbone of my infra-as-code setup.  
- 🛠 **Additional Helpful Operational Tools** (e.g., Atlantis) – Because automation is life.  

### ❗ About the Directory Name  
Don't stress about the name—it’s just some **wordplay for fun**. Since most of the stuff here is *ocean-related*, I figured, why not make it sound cool? No hidden meanings, no secret codes—just vibes. 🌊✨  

So, with that said… **Bon appétit! 🍽️**
